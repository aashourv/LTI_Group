function [A_opt,J_opt] = LTI_Group(V)
% LTI_GROUP estimates the parameters of a first-order multivariate AR model 
% for each subject's multivariate time series.
%
% Syntax:
%   [A_opt, J_opt] = LTI_Group(V)
%
% Input:
%   V - A cell array where each cell V{subject_i} is an (n by t) matrix 
%   containing the time series data for subject i. Rows of V{subject_i} 
%   represent variables, and columns represent observations.
%
% Output:
%   A_opt - Estimated coefficient matrix (n by n).
%   J_opt - The value of the cost function at the optimal A.
%
% Description:
%   This function estimates the parameters of a first-order multivariate AR 
%   model for each subject's multivariate time series. The model is defined 
%   as:
%
%       x(:,k) = A*x(:,k-1) + noise,
%
%   where x is the state vector and A is the system matrix to be estimated. 
%   The function provides least squares estimates of the coefficient matrix 
%   A (n*n) and assumes that the AR process has zero mean.
%
%   The optimization problem is defined as minimizing the sum of squared 
%   errors across all subjects:
%
%       J(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{T} (x_i[k] - \hat{x}_i[k])^2,
%
%   where x_i[k] is the observed data for subject i at time k, and 
%   \hat{x}_i[k] is the model prediction based on the LTI system with 
%   system matrix A. The optimization is performed using iterative 
%   algorithms such as the quasi-Newton method.
%
%   To find the optimal matrix A, we used the fminunc function as follows:
%
%       [A_opt, J_opt] = fminunc(@(A) cost_function(A, V), A0, options);
%
%   - fminunc: This is a function used for unconstrained optimization. It 
%     finds the minimum of an unconstrained multivariable function.
%   - @(A) cost_function(A, V): This creates an anonymous function that 
%     takes A as an input and calls the cost_function with A and V. The 
%     cost_function calculates the sum of squared errors between the 
%     observed data and the model predictions.
%   - A0: This is the initial guess for the system matrix A. It is an 
%     identity matrix of appropriate size.
%   - options: These are optimization options specified by the optimoptions 
%     function. In this case, 'Display' is set to 'iter-detailed' to provide 
%     detailed information at each iteration of the optimization process.
%   - A_opt: This is the output of fminunc, representing the optimal system 
%     matrix A that minimizes the cost function.
%   - J_opt: This is the value of the cost function at the optimal A.
